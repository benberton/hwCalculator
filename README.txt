**Calculator Program README**

This repository contains a simple integer calculator program implemented in C++. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and evaluates mathematical expressions provided in infix notation.

### How to Compile and Run
- To compile the program, simply run `make` in the terminal.
- To remove the generated object files, use `make clean`.
- To run:
    ./calc "<add expression>"
    Ex:
      ./calc "(3+2)*5"

### What it returns
- Shows how the calculator breaks down the expression (converting from infix to postfix) with pemdas
- Returns the calculated value

### Contributors
- Developed by Ben Berton for C++ class
